<h2>Bum, 
    <br></br>
    You never stayed, i don't understand why and i don't think i ever will, hopefeully some day i will. Maybe we were always running on borrowed time, a flame too big for the small space we tried to hold it in. I don't know if you'll ever visit this website again, but if you do, this is just a letter i thought to write to you. I don't know if you'll actually read it, or even feel it, but still i'll write it, even if only to release the weight of all i never got to say and calm the raging storm of emotions in me.
    <br></br>
    There was a time when i thought we'd outrun the chaos, the miscommunications, the falling outs, the pieces we kept trying to pick up and make whole again. We always ended up back in each other's arms, even after everything. Trying. Again and again. But somehow never quite making it.
    <br> </br>
    I loved you beyond what we made the center of us. Beyond the teasing touches and blurred boundaries. I saw you, i truly did. In your quiet moments, in your laughter, in your struggles, in the pauses between our chaos, in your voice, in the way i memorized the small versions of you that the world never saw, beyond the late-night calls and whispered confessions. I believed in the version of you that i don't even think you saw yet. You were home to me in ways no place or person ever was.
      <br> 
  </br>
    And even now, after the silences, after the endings that never felt like real ends, I love you. Still. Always & Forever. You know i used to say that to you, not as a passing phrase, but as a promise, one i never broke, one i won't.
    <br></br>
    I'll be somewhere you won't see, cheering you on louder than anyone else ever will. From the sidelines, from the shadows, from a heart that still echoes your name. I'll be your quiet supporter, your forever believer. You may never come back, and i may never be yours again, but in the softest corners of who i am, you always will be.
    <br> </br>
    Even if life moves on and i with it, some part of me will always be standing at the door, not waiting, not hoping, just loving you. Like a garden no longer tended but still blooming each spring because the roots were planted deep.
    <br>
    </br>
in this life and the next, always and forever ðŸ’—   <br><br>
    Yours,
    <br></br>
    Even in absence.</h2></div>
